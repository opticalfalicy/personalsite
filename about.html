           Within the last few months I have taught myself HTML and CSS, and have been getting into the basics of javascript. I have also been learning programming at Moraine.

            Within music, I have self-taught almost all the instruments I can play (guitar, bass guitar, drums, keyboard). An additional skill I have been working on as a hobby is audio recording and production.
